- basics
	- global service
	- 3 access options: Console (via password, maybe mfa), CLI (via access keys), SDK (also via access keys)
	- Policies (user and group permissions) and Roles (AWS service permissions)
	- can set conditions for IAM accesses: e.g. restrict calls based on IP, regions calls are made to, who's allowed to start/stop instances
- security tools: Credentials Report, Access Advisor
	- CR: acct level, list all users and status of credentials
	- AA: user level. Show users permissions and when those services were last accessed
- AWS EC2 Instance Metadata
	- allows EC2 inst to learn about themselves: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
	- works only from within EC2 inst. Can get role name, not full IAM policy
- AWS Policy Simulator
	- tool to test IAM policies. In sim, select user/group/role and action to test. Will return allowed or denied.
- AWS STS: Security Token Service
	- grant limited and *temp* (<= 1hr) access to AWS resources
- Active Directory (AD)
	- catalog of accounts, devices, security groups, etc., for centralized security/ access management on AWS
- Identity Federation & Cognito
	- IF: lets non-AWS users assume a temp role. 
		- New way: AWS SSO. Centrally manage SSO to access mult accounts, 3rd party apps. Centralized CloudTrail audits. Integrates wiht AWS organizations and on-prem AD, supports SAML 2.0
		- Old way: SAML 2.0 Federation. Web based, cross-domain SSO, integrates w AD/ ADFS. 
			- Custom ID Broker Application: if ID provider not compatible with SAML. 
	- AWS Cognito: federate user accts & provide them w IAM policy. Login to federated ID provider, get temp AWS creds back from Federated ID Pool. Creds include IAM policy.
- AWS Directory Services: for Windows AD integration. 3 flavors:
	- AWS Managed Microsoft AD: on prem & AWS. Create AD in AWS, manage users locally, est "trust" connections to your on-prem AD (so shared users)
	- AD Connector: on prem only. Users managed on-prem, directory Gateway (proxy) redirects to that on-prem AD.
	- Simple AD: AWS only. AD compatible managed directory on AWS.
- AWS Organizations
	- global service. User one master acct to manage all your orgs AWS accounts. Easier management, consolidated billing, aggregate pricing discounts, can automate acct creation. 
	- segment accounts into organizational units (OUs) and apply service control policies (SCPs) at either OU or acct. level. SCP applied to all users/ roles, incl. root.
- IAM Roles vs. Resource Based Policies (RBPs)
	- the principal doesn't give up their orig. role when using RBPs. RBPs can be applies to s3, sns topics, SQS queries
- IAM Permission Boundaries
	- define the max permissions for a user or role. Any capabilities attached to a managed policy outside this bound will be denied.
- AWS RAM: Resource Access Manager
	- share your AWS resources with any other acct in your org. 
	- E.g. share VPC Subnet (not default or security group)-- manage only your own resources, but any resources deployed w/in the subnet can talk to each other.
