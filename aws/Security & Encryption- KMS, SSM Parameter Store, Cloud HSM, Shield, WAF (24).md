- KMS (Key Management Service)
	- fully integrated with IAM for auth.
	- two CMK (customer master key) types:
		- Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
			- single key used to both encrypt and decrypt. You never see unencrypted key-- must call KMS API to use. 
			- Used by AWS services int. w/ KMS. Necessary for envelope encryption
		- Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
			- public (encryption) and private (decryption) key pair used for en-/de-crypt or sign/verify ops. 
			- Can't get unencrypted private key. Use case: encryption outside AWS by users who can't call KMS api
	- three ways to get CMKs:
		-  AWS managed service default CMK: free
		-  User keys created in KMS: $1/month
		-  User keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1/month
	-  Envelope encryption
		-  KMS can only encrypt <= 4kb of data/call. >4kb requires EE.
	-  KMS keys are region-bound. How to share encrypted EBS vols? 
		-  Cross region: snapshot in same region (snapshot always has same encryption) -> copy snapshot to new region, specifying a new key -> new col from snapshot will use new key.
		-  Cross account: create snapshot -> attach KMS key policy to auth x-account access -> share encrypted snapshot -> in target acct, create copy of snapshot, encrypting w KMS key from your acct -> create vol from snapshot
	-  KMS key policies: needed to control access. Default is complete access to key given to root user. In custom policy can define users/ roles that can access and administer key (useful for cross acct access)
	-  KMS Key Rotation: Automatic or Manual
		-  automatic key rotation: can only enable for customer (not AWS) managed symmetric CMK. Every one year (cannot change). New key has same CMK-ID, only backing key is changed. Old backing key stored for decryption purposes.
		-  manual key rotation: when you want rotation != 1yr. New key has different CMK ID; best practice is to use aliases to hide change of key for the app.
-  SSM Parameter Store
	-  secure storage for config & secrets, optional encryption w/ KMS. Serverless, scalable, durable. Version tracking. 
	-  Parameters Policies- only for advanced parameters (paid): assign parameter TTL to force updating/ deleting sensitive data
-  AWS Secrets Manager
	-  new than SSM PS, focused on storing secrets.
	-  Can force secret rotation every x-days, can automate secret generation w/ Lambda.
	-  integration w Amazon RDS to sync secrets btw db & secrets manager. Encrypted w/ KMS.
-  Cloud HSM
	-  encryption alternative...
		-  KMS => AWS manages software for encryption
		-  CloudHSM => AWS provides encryption *hardware*, use your own client for the encryption (cloud HSM software)
	-  HSM := Hardware Security Module: you manage your own encryption keys entirely. Tamper resistant. 
	-  C HSM clusters spread across multi-AZ (HA)- you must set up. Supports sym & asym encryption.
-  AWS Shield: DDOS Protection
	-  AWS Shield Standard: 
		-  free and active for every AWS customer. Protection for SYN/UDP Floods, reflection attacks, other layer 3/ layer 4 attacks.
	-  Shield Advanced
		-  protect for more sophisticated attacks, on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, R53. Gives 24/7 access to AWS DDOS response team.
		-  $3k/month/org; any increased costs from usage spikes due to DDOS are waived.
-  AWS WAF (web application firewall)
	-  protect web apps from common layer 7 (HTTP) exploits (SQL injection, XSS). Can deploy on ALB, API GW, or CloudFront
	-  must define web ACL (access control list): rules can include IP addresses, http headers, http body, or URI strings. Can put size contraints on queries, use geo-match  to block specific countries, apply rate-based rules (e.g. count occurrence of events/IP) for DDoS protection
-  AWS Firewall Manager
	-  manage all rules of all WAFs w/in your org
	-  define common set of security rules
		-  WAF rules (ALB, API GWs, CloudFront)
		-  AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
		-  Security Groups for EC2 & ENI resources in VPC
-  Amazon GuardDuty
	-  intelligent thread discovery service to protect AWS acct- anomaly detection analyzing CT Logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs
	-  Set up CloudWatch event rules to be notified in case of findings (can target Lambda or SNS)
	-  Dedicated findings for cryptocurrency attacks
- Amazon Inspector: Automated Security Assessments for EC2 inst. checks directly from w/in the OS
	- analyze the running OS against known vulnerabilities & against unintended network acessibility
	- to use, install AWS inspector Agent on OS of the EC2 inst
- Amazon Macie
	- fully managed data security and data privacy service
		- uses ML pattern matching to discover & protect sensitive data in AWS- e.g. can ID & alert you to PII (personally identifiable info) in your s3 bucket
